							<h2>SOUR SOUP FISH</h2>
						</div>
						<div class="section-details">
							<p>
			One just cannot visit Guiyang without trying its famous fish in sour soup! This delectable soup is so common and in high demand that it can be had from street stalls. It is THE traditional Maio soup and each Miao family has its own special recipe! But all comes in a large pot and rumour is that Miao girls who don’t know how to make it won’t be able to find a husband.
<br><br>
The story behind the soup is that there once was a pretty brew master in the Miaoling Mountains whose wine was sweet as honey and clear as  spring water.  She had many suitors and she used to sing, “with love, water can become sweet wine; without love, sweet wine will turn sour.”  If she didn’t like her suitors, she would serve them sour wine.
<br><br>
The soup can come in a red or white soup base.  The red base is from fermented wild tomatoes and the white, fermented rice. The fish is boiled in the soup base with garlic, ginger, salt, chili, wine and special fragrant spices.  Tofu and vegetables are usually added to the pot just before serving.
